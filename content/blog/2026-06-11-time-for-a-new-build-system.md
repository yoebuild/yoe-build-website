I've been building products using embedded Linux for the past 20 years. The
first time I tried OpenEmbedded (the precursor to Yocto), it felt like a gift to
be able to run a single command and build a bootable ARM image from my x86
workstation. But things are changing. We have more and more components (both
hardware and software) available. We have AI tools. We have powerful processors
with loads of memory. Small teams (startups and industrial companies building
small/medium volume connected products) want to do bigger things, yet they
struggle with the complexity of stitching it all together, miss their shipping
dates, and strain to maintain these systems once they're in the field. This
article explores what has changed, and how we can build and maintain embedded
Linux systems more efficiently.

## The Embedded Systems Golden Age

We live in a remarkable time for embedded systems engineering. We have:

- A large number of Linux system-on-modules (SOMs), perfect hardware building
  blocks for industrial products.
- Zephyr, an excellent OS for building software on MCU platforms.
- Mature tools (compilers, build systems, etc.).
- A vast array of open source software we can apply to these systems.
- Fast, reasonably priced prototyping (PCB assembly, mechanical 3D printing,
  etc.).
- More vendors upstreaming their Linux kernel support.
- Yocto's solid tooling for building images and custom parts of the system.

And all of this is available to companies of any size. It's a bit like
inheriting a mansion: open source has handed us a sprawling house full of rooms
and features we'd never have built ourselves, and we have to live in it to stay
competitive. The catch is that nobody handed us the tools to keep the place
running. There is nothing holding us back, except our ability to put it all
together.

## How Embedded Linux Systems are currently built

Embedded Linux build systems solve the problem of putting all the pieces
together, and the existing ones have served us well. Buildroot (2001) and
OpenEmbedded/Yocto (2003) are now the standard, supported by most SOC/SOM
vendors, and some teams ship successfully on Debian, Ubuntu, or even Arch (as
Valve does with the Steam Deck).

The shape of mainstream embedded Linux development has held remarkably steady
for ~20 years: cross-compile on a powerful x86 workstation, assemble a BSP
(board support package), freeze an SDK (software development kit), ship the
image, and hold that line for years. It's a model built for a static,
single-purpose, rarely updated product, and until recently, for that product, it
worked well.

## But things are changing ...

The products have changed more than the tools that build them. Edge devices have
started behaving like cloud systems. They run containers, pull OTA (over the
air) updates, stream telemetry, and are managed remotely over their entire life.
A device is no longer a static artifact you flash once and forget; it's a system
that keeps moving forward after it ships. That inverts the old release cadence:
instead of freezing an SDK and holding it for years, teams track upstream
continuously and push updates as a matter of course. The long LTS (long-term
support) freeze that the cross-compile model was built around no longer fits a
new class of products.

At the same time, the software itself has outgrown the cross-compile model.
Modern languages each ship their own package ecosystem: Python (wrapping
C/C++/CUDA via NumPy and PyTorch), JavaScript (linking to C libraries), Go,
Rust, and vcpkg (for C/C++). Most of it is written for desktop/server, not
cross-compilation. That puts the cross-compile burden squarely on embedded
developers, and maintaining recipes for thousands of packages has been a steady
drain on the Yocto community. Yocto compounds this by blocking network access
during the build, so language package tooling doesn't work without complex
`do_fetch` integration. That's useful when you must control every source, but
unnecessary friction for many projects.

Each of these solutions trades one problem for another. Building everything from
source in Yocto means long builds, heavy memory use, and powerful workstations.
A stock binary distro like Debian starts development faster but lacks the
tooling to integrate the custom parts. And vendor BSPs frozen on a 4-year-old
Yocto make it hard to integrate modern software at all.

We could go on, but the cause is structural. Talented teams working hard still
hit this, because the problem is inherently difficult and the software keeps
getting harder to build.

To summarize, three things have changed:

1. **Products never stop moving.** Edge devices now behave like cloud systems:
   continuous OTA updates, not a multi-year freeze.
2. **Software outgrew cross-compilation.** Every modern language brings its own
   package ecosystem that doesn't always cross-compile cleanly.
3. **The old tradeoffs got sharper.** Build-from-source is slow and heavy; stock
   distros lack custom tooling; BSPs freeze you in time.

The old model is good. The real question is whether it still fits the product
you're building and the team you have.

## Small teams have different problems, not smaller ones

I've been talking to a lot of people building products, and keep hearing a
consistent message. First, the ground has shifted: both the products and the way
we have to put them together. Second, what works for a big team doesn't always
work for a small one.

Small teams and startups need to build and ship. They often don't have the
resources to sustain multi-year development cycles. They don't have dedicated
build or platform engineers experienced in creating complex build infrastructure
and debugging hard build problems. Simplicity and ease of build/deployment often
matter more than binary-reproducible builds or building everything from scratch.
Easily deploying the latest open-source releases is frequently required to
leverage new technologies.

These teams are often hampered by three things: vendor BSPs that lock them into
old versions of Yocto, frustrating debug cycles where a critical component won't
build, and the heavy effort of back-porting needed components into a system
frozen in time. A large organization can hire dedicated experts and throw
resources at these problems. A small organization does not have this luxury.

To be clear, small != hobbyist. These are often startups or industrial products
produced at moderate scale (100's to 1000's of units) that sit between the
one-off maker projects and consumer scale mass production.

## The new opportunity

Buildroot and OpenEmbedded were created in an era when ARM-based computers were
slow, and cross-compiling software on powerful x86 workstations was the only
practical option. When we were building a limited set of C/C++-based
applications, these systems worked great. However, several things have changed
in recent times:

1. Application development is moving to modern languages (Python, JS, Go, Rust,
   Zig). These languages have their own package ecosystems, caching, etc.
2. The hardware story has flipped. We now have fast ARM computers (AWS Graviton,
   Hetzner CAX) available for building and are no longer constrained to x86
   workstations.
3. AI has emerged as a powerful tool for creating software, including build
   systems.

We need to leverage these change agents and rethink the world of connected
products. The key shift is this: stop borrowing only the _technology_ of modern
ecosystems, and start borrowing their _process_ too. When we adopt Rust or
Python and take the language but force it into the old build process, it's a bit
like running a train on a paved road. The win comes from adopting how those
ecosystems build, package, and cache, not just what they produce.

We now have an opportunity to rethink embedded Linux build systems. For me, this
got personal. It hit me recently — if I'm going to keep doing this for another
20 years, I want something different, something that better fits the problems my
customers and I are actually trying to solve, instead of fighting the tools.

So I've been experimenting. Over the past couple of months I've been building
real pieces of this in the open, and the early results have been encouraging:
software that used to mean a day of fighting cross-compilation now goes from
idea to running on target hardware in minutes, using the same tooling on my
laptop and in CI. It's rough and early, but it's enough to convince me this
approach is worth pursuing.

## What if ...

... we could:

- **Get to market faster.** Shorten the path from idea to a working product.
  - Takes an idea to running on target hardware in seconds to minutes, not days
    or weeks.
  - Doesn't require cross-compilation.
  - Leverages modern language ecosystems (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Zig,
    pkgbuild, etc.).
  - Caches builds so no piece of software is built twice.
  - Provides the convenience of pre-built packages from mainstream distributions
    with the tooling benefits of Yocto.
- **Do more with a small team.** One toolset the whole team (and AI) can use, so
  you don't need dedicated build specialists.
  - Provides one build system for applications and system software: the same
    tooling on laptop, cloud CI, and build farms.
  - Is easy for humans and AI to understand.
  - Includes tooling that works well with AI agents.
  - Leverages AI to do most of the low-level work.
  - Provides error messages that clearly point to the problem.
- **Keep products current and supportable in the field.** Stay on modern
  software and maintain devices over their whole life.
  - Tracks current software versions easily, without being held back by vendor
    BSPs.
  - Scales from system to application to CI with consistent tooling throughout.
  - Deploys updates to fielded devices easily.

(These problems seem universal, but they hit small teams disproportionately
hard, since those teams rarely have dedicated resources to solve them.)

This is what I am experimenting with in this
[next-generation Embedded Linux build system](https://yoebuild.org/). A few
examples of how this tool makes development easier:

- [Alpine](https://yoebuild.org/blog/first-walkthrough-videos/),
  [Debian](https://yoebuild.org/blog/adding-debian/), and
  [Ubuntu](https://yoebuild.org/blog/adding-ubuntu/) are all supported base
  distributions that get us going quickly without rebuilding the world.
- Integrate
  [Python and JavaScript](https://yoebuild.org/blog/pip-and-npm-on-the-target/)
  native package ecosystems instead of fighting them.
- First-class [AI support](https://yoebuild.org/blog/ai-integration/).
- The [terminal user interface (TUI)](https://yoebuild.org/blog/why-a-tui/) is
  fast, and allows us to easily monitor what is going on and drill down into
  detailed information as needed.

A few key features are still missing, such as distributed caching and remote
build runners, but these are coming soon.

## The old models still have their place

None of this means the old models are going away, or should. For deeply embedded
regulated products (compliance-certified, bit-reproducible, built entirely from
source, and intentionally frozen for years), Yocto is battle-tested and remains
the right tool. It does exactly what those products need, and it does it well.

We've seen this pattern before. Alpine Linux didn't replace Debian. It answered
a different need: minimal, container-friendly images. Both distributions still
ship today, serving different points in the design space. Nobody frames it as a
competition; they're simply shaped for different jobs.

The same is true here. Dynamic, connected, frequently updated devices built with
modern languages are a different job, and they deserve a tool built for that
job.

## So, is it time?

For a real and growing class of teams and products, I think the answer is yes.
[`[yoe]` build](https://yoebuild.org/) is an early experiment exploring what
that could look like. It's pre-1.0 and developed in the open, rough edges and
all. It's a bet that this is a problem worth solving, and an invitation to work
out the shape of the solution together.

It depends on you: the teams building products and the vendors that support
them. Provide feedback. What am I missing? Test it out and let me know how it
works. [Sign up](https://yoebuild.org/) for my newsletter. Tell your vendors you
need something like this. Like/watch the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/yoebuild/yoe). Share it with someone who might
be interested. Contribute improvements. Fund development or infrastructure. Many
small teams need this, and these small companies form a significant portion of
the global economy (the long tail). Startups are where a lot of innovation
happens. And if a community emerges who can leverage modern AI tools, it will
happen. The
[progress in the past two months](https://github.com/yoebuild/yoe/releases)
demonstrates this is possible.
